      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My name is Novia. I'm a recent history graduate from Georgia State University. I am bilingual in Vietnamese and English. I was fortunate enoughh to have taught English to university students abroad in Japan before the pandemic. I love learning about new culutres, trying new foods, and expriencing different changes life offers. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in Geogira.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>In my free time I like to read and brush up on my Japanese. I also love to game even though I'm stuck in bronze.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I have always been a free-spirited person and I enjoy working with others. My dream job would allow me to make a positive impact on people everyday and to hopefully make a differnce in the world. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in the Metro-Atlanta area.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I was on track to become an English teacher abroad before the pandemic. For a while, it felt like my future was uncertain until I considered becoming a web devoloper. Learning how to code is an invaluable skill in and of itself. Coding provides a range of oppritunities and challenges for devolopers. I hope to grow my skill set and challenge myself to see how far I can go. </p>
